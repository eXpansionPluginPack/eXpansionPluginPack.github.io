## Introduction


**Welcome to the eXpansion developper documentation.**

Suprising as it might like our non finished version of eXpansion2 has more documentation & cookbooks then eXpansion1. 

We are going to try and keep the documentation clean & uptodate for you guys to create awsome plugins, 
sorry I mean Awsome Bundles. Yep behind the hood there is [Symfony!](https://symfony.com/) now, symfony 3.2. 

I recomend any developper that wishes to start making a plugin to atleast look into some parts of the Symfony documentation : 
* [Dependency Injection](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection.html)
* [Translations](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/translation.html)
* [Console](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console.html)

The documentation is seprated in 3 parts, first in the Introduction we will see how a eXpansion bundles work. It's very similar to symfony but we a few changes on how game events are dispatched. In the second part the documention will elaborate on various services you might need to use to create a bundle. And finally the last "cookbook" part will give exemples in order to explain exactly how to do things. 

If you were not convinced in the power of DI until now, it's time to be. 

eXpansion is based on the [Symfony!](https://symfony.com/) framwork. 
And uses steeffeen's [Fancy Manialink's](https://github.com/steeffeen/FancyManiaLinks) to handle it's manialinks.
