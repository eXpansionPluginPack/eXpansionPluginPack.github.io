## Introduction

**Welcome to the eXpansion developer documentation.**

Surprising as it might like our non finished version of eXpansion<sup>2</sup> has more documentation & cookbooks then eXpansion<sup>1</sup>. 

We are going to try and keep the documentation clean & up-to-date for you guys to create awesome <del>plugins</del>! 
...I mean Awesome Bundles! eXpansion<sup>2</sup> is based on the [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) framework and 
uses steeffeen's [Fancy Manialink's](https://github.com/steeffeen/FancyManiaLinks) to handle UI knows as manialinks. 
 
If you are not yet familiar with symfony components, please take a good look to the following concepts:
* [Dependency Injection](http://symfony.com/doc/3.3/components/dependency_injection.html)
* [Translations](http://symfony.com/doc/3.3/components/translation.html)
* [Console](http://symfony.com/doc/3.3/components/console.html)

This documentation is separated in multiple parts.

1. The first part we will see how a eXpansion bundles work.
It's very similar to symfony but we a few changes on how game events are dispatched. 
2. In the second part the documentation will elaborate on various services you might need to use to create a bundle. 
3. And finally the last "cookbook" part will give examples in order to explain exactly how to do things.
