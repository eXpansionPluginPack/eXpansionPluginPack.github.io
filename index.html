<h1>Welcome to eXpansion</h1>

<p>eXpansion is a Dedicated Server Controller for ManiaPlanet games by Ubisoft/NADEO, adding very cool features to the online gaming experience! </p>

<p>
    eXpansion V1 support was dropped during MP#4 Beta; it required a total overhaul before it could become compatible with the latests version of the game.
    eXpansion V1 contained quite a long list of technical dept coming from usage of unmaintained libraries as well as design errors.
</p>

<p>
    At that point we decided that it was impossible for 2 people to work it to the new standarts while keeping all the functionalities.
    And therefore started the development of eXpansion V2.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>eXpansion V2 is still in developmment and we don't expect a release even alpha anytime soon.</strong>
    We wish tto put in place solid bases before starting to create add functionnalities to the system.
    We don't expect the second version to ever have as much feature as the first version, we are going to rely on the community for that.
</p>

<p>
    eXpansion 2 is <a href="http://symfony.com">Symfony</a> based. This allows eXpansion 2  to be very modular.<br/>
    The Manialink engine uses steeffeen's <a href="https://github.com/steeffeen/FancyManiaLinks">Fancy Manialink's</a> library with some custom parts to inject maniascript.
</p>

    Top features to expect :

                        eXpansion supports multilingual messages. So translating eXpansion for a new language isn't hacking.
                        It just part of what it is meant to do. Contact us if you wish to work on the translations
